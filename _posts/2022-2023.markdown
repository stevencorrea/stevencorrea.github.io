I facilitate and teach up to two online sections a semester for the Computer Science department at Butte College. These involve creating video content and mini-lectures, hosting video conferences for office hours and providing timely support and feedback to students as they grow their knowledge of computing and security. This is my 'night and weekend' activity!
