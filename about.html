## About

I am a technologist who is seeking an Engineering role on a Cloud Infrastructure, SRE, DevSecOps or Platform team. I have a wide range of experience as I've grown my skill set and taken on new and exciting challenges at every step. I love working with code and automating where it makes sense to (almost everywhere). I also understand the value of human decision making and contextual inference that can be difficult to translate to a system or orchestration. I had planned on making Red Canary my first 5+ year company but that got cut short by the current and projected economic outlook. I hope to land a role at an organization that enables me to do my best work so I can make this dream my reality.
