## About

I am a technologist who is seeking an Engineering role on a Cloud Infrastructure, SRE, Platform, DevSecOps or related team. 
I have a broad range of experience, 5 years of which working on a Software Engineering team to make production environments more reliable, cost effective and scalable.
I love leveraging code to automate away toil and understand the value of platforms that are observable, measurable and performant. 
I planned on making Red Canary my first 5+ year company but that got cut short by the company's projected economic outlook. 
I hope to land a role at an organization that enables me to do my best work so I can make this dream my reality.

Thanks for stopping by!
